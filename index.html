        Forged in Fire, Bound by Unity</h2>

        <h2>1947 — The Beginning</h2>
        <h6>Pakistan emerged as an independent state, and with it rose the foundation of a dedicated armed force to
          protect its sovereignty. <br> <br>
          With limited resources but limitless resolve, Pakistan's military was born from the ashes of partition. The mission was clear: defend the homeland at all costs. What followed was a story of resilience, strategy, and unmatched bravery — a story still being written in the hearts of every Pakistani.

        <h2>1965 — Defenders of the Green</h2>
        <p>India thought they could break us. Instead, they witnessed the fury of a nation united. <br> <br>Pakistan’s brave soldiers and airmen not only defended our borders but pushed back with such strength that legends like MM Alam were born — downing 5 Indian aircraft in under a minute. Courage wasn’t just a word; it flew through our skies that day.</p>

        <h2>1971 — Standing Tall Amidst Trials</h2>
        <p>Though the nation faced internal and external turmoil, the spirit of our armed forces never faltered. <br>
          <br> Even in the face of overwhelming odds, our men and women in uniform upheld their oaths, fighting not just battles — but history’s weight. This war tested our soul, and we emerged with scars that spoke of unmatched loyalty and grit.</p>

        <h2>Kashmir — Our Soul, Our Struggle</h2>
        <p>They can take our land, but not our spirit. <br> <br> Kashmir runs through the veins of every Pakistani — and so, our soldiers stand guard not just at the LOC, but at the heart of a dream we've never abandoned. Every bullet fired there echoes a promise: we will never forget, and we will never give up.</p>

        <h2>Now Pahalgam: From Accusation to Action</h2>
        <h6>When fingers were pointed at Pakistan for the Pahalgam attack — without evidence, of course — the response wasn’t fear. It was fire. <br><br> When their Rafales came roaring in with arrogance, we met them mid-air. One got clipped and kissed the earth faster than their claims could spread. The message was clear: think twice before blaming us, or you’ll find your ‘Rafale’ turning into a 'Ra<span class="k">Fail </span>'.</h6>
